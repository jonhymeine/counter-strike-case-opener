# Counter Strike Case Simulator

This project is going to be a Counter Strike case simulator, initially developing with Vite, React.js, Node.js, Typescript and TailwindCSS.

## Probably features for the future:

-   Database implementation
-   Convert into an Electron.js desktop app

## Installation and Execution

These instructions will be set during the development, as I may change how to approach the solution.
